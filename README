This is the code, data, and images for the point-process smoothing mini-workshop at UC-Davis, 30 Sept 2019.

In order to read along and generate your own output, open workshop.Rmd in R Studio. If you just want to read along without running your own code, try workshop.html or workshop.pdf. If you want to work with the code but not use R Studio, I've extracted just the code to workshop.R.
